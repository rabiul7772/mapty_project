# mapty_project

One of the coolest web applications I've ever worked on is Mapty. The application can be used to mark workouts(running 🏃‍♂️, cycling 🚴‍♀️) on the map where users performed. 

🟩 Getting the navigator geolocation coordinates in terms of latitude and longitude track the navigator's current location using the Geolocation API and then rendering the map. 

🟩 Clicking on the map a form will appear in the sidebar that will take all the data associated with the workout, after submitting the form a popup marker will be rendered on both the map and sidebar. 

🟩 Using the event delegation concept implemented a functionality that is moving the map to the corresponding workout popup when the user clicks on a certain workout.

🟩 Also used local storage API to make the workout data persist across multiple pages reloads.


During development, I utilized modern JavaScript features of OOP (object-oriented programming) such as classes, inheritance, private methods, and fields to create clean and organized code structure. 

The project also involved the integration of a popular mapping open-source third-party JavaScript library called  Leaflet, to provide an engaging user experience. 🌍🗺️
